## Chapter 3
1. 64 bit blocks and 80 bit key. 2^80 different keys. Number of possible 64 bit blocks is 2^64. Therefore, lookup table size is 2^64 x 80;

2.  DES key is 56 bits. So there are 2^56 possible keys for DES. Therefore, given the speed of 2^-26 seconds for a single ecryption/decryption,
it would take us 2^(56 - 26) = 2^30 seconds = 298,261.62 hours.

If we had 2^14 processors, it would take 2^16 seconds, which is 18.2 hours.

3.
E(K, P) = F(F(R, K1) xor L, K2) xor R

C1 = F(R, K1) xor L
C2 = F(C1, K2) xor R

Cipher text looks like C1 | C2

We have many pairs L|R and C1 | C2 that we know of.

Then we can perform an exhaustive search over K1, while fixing K2 to some arbitrary value and encrypting the plaintext until C1' = C1. This takes at most 2^48 iterations.

Now we just use the K1 we found and exhaustive search over K2. This takes at most 2^48 iterations. In total, this takes 2^49 iterations in the worst case.

## Chapter 4
1. This is not a good padding scheme because 0 is included as a valid number of padding bytes. This is an issue as it makes it impossible to reverse the padding because in the
case of n = 0, it won't be clear how many bytes were added since P || 0 is the same as P.

2. Since they are both encrypted with the same nonce, and we know one of the plaintexts, we can compute:

C1 xor C2 = P1 xor K1 xor P2 xor K2 = P1 xor P2 xor E(K, nonce || i) xor E(I, nonce || j) TODO: Come back to this.

6.

P1, P2 -> C0, C1, C2

P1' -> C0', C1'

C1' = C2

P1' = ...

C0 = IV
C1 = E(K, P1 xor C0)
C2 = E(K, P2 xor C1)

C0' = IV'
C1' = E(K, C0' xor P1')

C1' = C2 -> E(K, C0' xor P1') = E(K, P2 xor C1)

P1' = D(K, C1') xor IV'
->  = D(K, C2) xor IV'
->  = D(K, E(K, P2 xor C1)) xor IV'
->  = P2 xor C1 xor IV' since D(K, E(K, x)) = x
->  = P2 xor C1 xor C0'
-> attacker knows P1'
